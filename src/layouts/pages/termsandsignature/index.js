                              <b>Article 1: Agreement to Arbitrate:</b> It is understood that any
                              dispute as to medical, chiropractic and/or personal training
                              malpractice, that is as to whether any such services rendered under
                              this contract were unnecessary or unauthorized or were improperly,
                              negligently or incompetently rendered, will be determined by
                              submission to arbitration as provided by state and federal law, and
                              not by a lawsuit or resort to court process, except as state and
                              federal law provides for judicial review of arbitration proceedings.
                              Both parties to this contract, by entering into it, are giving up
                              their constitutional right to have any such dispute decided in a court
                              of law before a jury, and instead are accepting the use of
                              arbitration. Further, the parties will not have the right to
                              participate as a member of any class of claimants, and there shall be
                              no authority for any dispute to be decided on a class action basis. An
                              arbitration can only decide a dispute between the parties and may not
                              consolidate or join the claims of other persons who have similar
                              claims.

                              that any dispute that does not relate to medical, chiropractic or
                              personal training malpractice, including disputes as to whether or not
                              a dispute is subject to arbitration, as to whether this agreement is
                              unconscionable, and any procedural disputes, will also be determined
                              by submission to binding arbitration. It is the intention of the
                              parties that this agreement bind all parties as to all claims,
                              including claims arising out of or relating to treatment or services
                              provided by the care provider, including any heirs or past, present or
                              future spouse(s) of the Client in relation to all claims, including
                              loss of consortium. This agreement is also intended to bind any
                              children of the Client whether born or unborn at the time of the
                              occurrence giving rise to any claim. This agreement is intended to

                              providers, preceptors, interns or subcontractors who now or in the
                              future consult with the Client while employed by, working or
                              associated with or serving as a back-up for the care provider,
                              including those working at the care providers clinic or office or any
                              other clinic or office or facility or premises whether signatories to
                              this form or not. All claims for monetary damages exceeding the
                              jurisdictional limit of the small claims court against the care
                              provider, and/or the care providers associates, association,

                              estate, must be arbitrated including, without limitation, claims for
                              loss of consortium, wrongful death, emotional distress, injunctive
                              relief, or punitive damages. This agreement is intended to create an
                              open book account unless and until revoked.

                              <b>Article 3: Procedures and Applicable Law:</b> A demand for
                              arbitration must be communicated in writing to all parties. Each party
                              shall select an arbitrator (party arbitrator) within thirty days, and
                              a third arbitrator (neutral arbitrator) shall be selected by the
                              arbitrators appointed by the parties within thirty days thereafter.
                              The neutral arbitrator shall then be the sole arbitrator and shall
                              decide the arbitration. Each party to the arbitration shall pay such
                              partys pro rata share of the expenses and fees of the neutral
                              arbitrator, together with other expenses of the arbitration incurred
                              or approved by the neutral arbitrator, not including counsel fees,
                              witness fees, or other expenses incurred by a party for such partys
                              own benefit. Either party shall have the absolute right to bifurcate
                              the issues of liability and damage upon written request to the neutral
                              arbitrator. The parties consent to the intervention and joinder in
                              this arbitration of any person or entity that would otherwise be a
                              proper additional party in a court action, and upon such intervention
                              and joinder, any existing court action against such additional person
                              or entity shall be stayed pending arbitration. The parties agree that
                              provisions of state and federal law, where applicable, establishing
                              the right to introduce evidence of any amount payable as a benefit to
                              the Client to the maximum extent permitted by law, limiting the right
                              to recover non-economic losses, and the right to have a judgment for
                              future damages conformed to periodic payments, shall apply to disputes
                              within this Arbitration Agreement. The parties further agree that the
                              Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association
                              shall govern any arbitration conducted pursuant to this Arbitration
                              Agreement.

                              one proceeding. A claim shall be waived and forever barred if (1) on
                              the date notice thereof is received, the claim, if asserted in a civil
                              action, would be barred by the applicable legal statute of
                              limitations, or (2) the claimant fails to pursue the arbitration claim

                              if not revoked, will govern all professional services received by the
